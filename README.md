# Bisection Method

This repository contains a simple implementation of the bisection method using TypeScript.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to _src/utils/evalFunction.ts_.
3. Modify the **Return value** with your own function.

    **OPTIONAL:**
    You can also customize the range for the initial iteration and set the minimum required error for the script to terminate (using scientific notation is recommended).

    To make these changes, locate _src/lib/constants.ts_ and modify the values accordingly.

4. Run the script using _npm run start_.

Upon completion, an object will be printed to the console, with 'x' representing the result and 'currentError' indicating the current error of the operation.

# Bisection Method

Simple implementation of the bisection method using Typescript

## How to use it

1. Clone the repository
2. Search for _src/utils/evalFunction.ts_
3. Modify the **Return value** with your own function

**OPTIONAL:**
You can also change the range in which the values are generated for the
first iteration.

And also the minimun required error for the script to end (make sure to use cientific notation).

Search for *src/lib/constants.ts* and modify those values however you like.

4. Run the script using *npm run start*

At the end you will see and object printed to the console, being x, the result, and 
currentError, just, the current error of the operation.
